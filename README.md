-Creating a ticket flow: (example of values)
1  
movie   
Hobbit  
Normal  
1  
10

(all tickets will have id 0- unfortunately) 




-Reading a ticket flow: (example of values) (we need at least a value in "ExistingTicketsList.txt") 
(only accepting numbers)   
2   
0

(we can check if the ticket id (which is 0 in our case) exists in the list or not)  
( we can also print the whole list of id s if we really want to)  

Throw ex :exist for all attributes Except: -mainMenuOption (first value we write)  
                                           -row and seat  

-The aplication still needs a lot of work but at least it is running.
